Could you please tell me the details of that package? My name is Stella. And your address? Number eight Pike Street, Seattle. And your phone number? Four two five million three hundred and thirty six thousand seven hundred and seventy six. All right. This package is valid till when? For two month. Great. What are all formalities needed to be done? Is there a nonstop flight that I can take? That sounds better but it's a little longer. Oh, yes, that's right. Yes, please. How can I make the payment? You can pay by card, cash or check. Is it possible that I can pay online? You can do that as well. Just send me your count details via WhatsApp. No. Any airline will be fine. I'm not picky. Economy, please. Vouch, I was hoping to find something cheaper. My dates are flexible. Do you find a cheaper flight? Can you tell me your email id? Stellaratemail.com. You would receive the eTicket's details. Okay, in case if I need to cancel the ticket, to whom should I contact? All right, would I get refund if I cancel the ticket? How long that voucher valid?"

        "complete_trans": "That sound great. How long is your vacation? Just one week. Here's our Singapore brochure. We will arrange everything. Oh great. Have a look and see if there's a hotel you like. I like Hotel Hilton. It's expensive but I've been told it's very nice. Yes, some accommodations, we have recently prepared an amazing package for that. Sure ma'am. In that package, you will get four nights and three days. Would you like to make the booking now? Yes please. I just need to take some personal information. May I know your name? Will you be traveling alone? I'm traveling with my husband. Shall I book your ticket on January 28th? You have to pay two hundred dollars with a copy of your proof and photograph. Yes, speed airways that flight departs at six p.m. on Saturday morning and arrives at Singapore three p.m. Well, it's an eight hours long flight. Don't forget the time difference. Shall I reserve a seat for you? When would you like to return? February 4th. Do you have an airline preference? And what class would you like? Economy, business class, or first class? Okay, well there's a flight on the morning of the 4th. The cheapest we have is $700. Let me check. Just a moment. There's a flight on the February 10th for $120. That's much better. But you have to change planes twice once in Texas and again in London. Is that the best you can do? I'm afraid so. If you'd like, I can book the ticket and seat as well. Perfect, thank you. It includes your flight confirmation number. When you check in at the airport, they will ask you to confirm the code. You need to contact us or Airways toll free number. No, you won't get refund but I can give you the voucher. One year validity, you can travel any destination. Oh great.
